NAME
    WWW::Shorten::VGd - shorten (or lengthen) URLs with http://v.gd

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Shorten::VGd;
        use WWW::Shorten 'VGd';

        my $url = q{http://averylong.link/wow?thats=really&really=long};
        my $short_url = makeashorterlink($url);
        my $long_url  = makealongerlink($short_url); # eq $url

DESCRIPTION
    A Perl interface to the web site <http://v.gd>. v.gd simply maintains a
    database of long URLs, each of which has a unique identifier. By
    default, this URL shortening service will show you a preview page before
    redirecting you. This can be turned off by setting a cookie at
    <http://v.gd/previews.php>.

Functions
  makeashorterlink
    The function "makeashorterlink" will call the v.gd web site passing it
    your long URL and will return the shortened link.

  makealongerlink
    The function "makealongerlink" does the reverse. "makealongerlink" will
    accept as an argument either the full TinyURL URL or just the TinyURL
    identifier.

    If anything goes wrong, then either function will return "undef".
